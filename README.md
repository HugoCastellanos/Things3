Things 3 Scripts:

A collection of Things 3 scripts. I run them using Keyboard Maestro and a hotkey. 

# 1) Time Estimate Script

Use case: Making sure the tasks I have selected have a time estimate and add up how long they will take. 

The EstimateTime script will calculate how much time you've allocated to your todos you have selected. You need to tag them with a tag in the format "‚è∞ XXmin" where "XX" can be any integer. I use 5,15,30,60 but you can use any you'd like. 
I like to use the clock emoji so I have a visual representation of which tags have a time estimate and which one don't. 


Use case: Plan what to work on tomorrow. Make sure I am being realistic and I schedule only 2-6 hours of work. 

Things lets you access a "Tomorrow" list by typing "Tomorrow" in any view. You can't access these todos via Applescript, however if you select them you can run the time estimate script on them. 

# 2) Todo counter

Use case: It's easy to add too many todos in the upcoming view when planning the week. I like to keep 10-15 max per day. This script is a quick way of selecting the todos assigned for a particular day and seeing at a glance how many tasks are assigned that day.
